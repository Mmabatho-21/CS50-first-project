Indoor Voice Project
Overview
This project is a simple Python program called indoor.py that prompts the user for input and returns the same text in all lowercase letters.
It keeps spaces and punctuation the same, only the letters change.


To complete this project, I had to:

Navigate through Git: I used Git to create, manage, and keep track of my project files. I learned to initialize a repository, create commits, check status, and push my code to a remote repository.

Overcome challenges: At first, it was challenging to understand how to move between directories, make sure Git recognized my files, and handle errors when committing or pushing.

Use Python basics: I learned how to use input() to get user input, print() to display output, and .lower() to transform strings to lowercase.

Integrate variables and functions: I practiced declaring variables to store user input and used built-in functions to modify and output that data.

One of the challenges i had, and i am still having , is navigating through Git, but i know with practice i will get better.
